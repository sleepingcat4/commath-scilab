# Computation Mathematics through Scilab

## Introduction 
Scilab is an Open Source software to perform mathematical calculation leveraging matrices. Quite like MatLab without those hefty fees. Scilab is extremely powerful and preferred by French Universities and Mathematics students for it’s fast and flexible and user friendly. 

Scilab, according to me, is the de’facto Emperor of Computational Mathematics. Because I love it’s simple scripting language and console a lot.

## What is this repository about?
I started my Scilab journey a little shy 11 months ago. I have experience with Wolfram Mathematica, which I use for most of my Computational activities in pure and natural sciences. But, I needed something powerful for mathematics and yet simple and elegant. 

Riemann Geometry and Mathematics charmed me, after reading through a project of the university of pauline dauphine’s one of the professors’ work. Python sucks a lot in this field and MatLab is too heavy to just perform mathematical calculations and quite similar to Wolfram, which is why I found this alternative, which I believe is better than octave. 

I made this repository to share scilab tutorials and computational mathematics projects, which I do in my free time. Both to track my progress and let the community learn from my work. Resources for Scilab are very scarce, only few books are available and tutorials are non-existent due to its nature to only entertain hardcore mathematicians and artificial intelligence researchers. 

You can use my work to learn and ask relevant questions in the issues section of the repo. 

## Prerequisites

* Scilab version 5
* Scilab version 6

I program in both of these versions. I prefer to be old school and use the Scilab console but if you are interested you can check the Scilab kernel for Jupyter Notebook.
